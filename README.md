## File setup

Fill out the entire USER CONFIGURATION section of the code.

You should leave "STEPS_TO_CLOSE" at 12 to start with.  It can be adjusted for your specific blinds

## Home Assistant YAML

Replace "BlindsMCU" with your MQTT_CLIENT_ID if you changed it in the file setup

```yaml

    command_topic: "BlindsMCU/blindsCommand"
    set_position_topic: "BlindsMCU/positionCommand"
